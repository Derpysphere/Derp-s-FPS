This is my attempt at an FPS controller

The hope is to be feature rich, simple, and ready for whatever modification you want to make.


Features:
  Running/walking
  crouching(will add soon.)
  Double Jump
  In air momentum/ or not.
  Special dashing ablility





SETUP:
  You will have to create several actions listed in the controller for this to work. OR just rebind the controller to different actions.
  Easy and Simple to setup.
